# About Pc Tools

## What does Pc Tools do
- This application has features that will make your work easier in many areas. Basically, you can start cleaning, optimizing, advanced file search, file shredding, and even difficult and time-consuming functions for your computer with just one click.

### 1. Cleaner
- The Cleaner process was developed mainly to clean up unnecessary files on the computer. It sorts the main folders of unnecessary files on your computer for you and allows you to clean them one by one as you wish. Thanks to this process, you can quickly clean them instead of deleting them one by one.

- 1.1 Temp Files
- Temp folder is a folder where temporary program data is kept. The Windows operating system does not clean this folder most of the time, but cleaning this folder has a big impact on the performance of the computer. This program does not delete files that are still being used in the background, it only deletes leftover temp files.

- 1.2 Prefetech Files
- The Prefetch folder holds preload data needed to load programs faster. Although the Windows operating system cleans this folder periodically, this does not always happen regularly. Cleaning the Prefetch folder can have a positive impact on your computer's performance. This program does not delete files that are still in use in the background, it only cleans unused and leftover preload files.

- 1.3 Reycle Bin
- The Recycle Bin is an area where deleted files are temporarily stored. In this way, accidentally deleted files can be recovered. However, over time, the files that accumulate in this box can negatively affect the performance of the computer by unnecessarily filling up disk space. This program permanently deletes the files in the Recycle Bin, freeing up disk space and improving your computer's performance.

- 1.4 System Log Files
- System log files record various events and errors of the computer and installed programs. These files are useful for monitoring system performance and diagnosing problems. However, over time, these files can accumulate and fill up disk space, negatively affecting the computer's performance. This program deletes unnecessary system log files to free up disk space and improve your computer's performance. Actively used log files remain untouched.

- 1.5 Download Files
- The Downloads folder is where files downloaded from the Internet and other sources are stored. Over time, the files that accumulate in this folder can fill up disk space and negatively affect the performance of the computer. This program deletes unused and unnecessary files from the Downloads folder, freeing up disk space and improving your computer's performance.

- 1.6 Windows Update Backup and Leftovers
- Windows Update Backups and Residuals occur when the operating system backs up old files after updates, leaving residual files. These backups and residual files can fill up disk space and negatively affect computer performance. This program frees up disk space and improves your computer's performance by cleaning unnecessary update backups and residual files. Actively used and important update files remain untouched.

-1.7 Image and Video Thumbnails
- Image and Video Previews allow quick viewing of thumbnails of images and videos in the file explorer. These previews are stored by creating thumbnail files of each file. Over time, these thumbnails can take up disk space and negatively affect the performance of the computer. This program frees up disk space and improves your computer's performance by cleaning up unused and unnecessary thumbnail files.

### 2. Optimizations

- 2.1 Startup Apps
- This feature allows you to disable the auto-start feature of applications that start automatically when your computer is turned on. A windows free of startup applications will start faster and the application running in the background will not be found until you turn it on. This is a great accelerator, especially for low-spec computers. With this feature you don't need to search for startup applications in the registry. Disabling an application's autostart does not harm the application.

- 2.2 Unused Memory
- Unused memory contains bits of data that are temporarily used during computer operation but are no longer required. This memory space can fill up over time, negatively affecting the overall performance of the computer and reducing the amount of memory needed for new processes. This program frees up unused and unnecessary memory space, allowing the system to run more efficiently and increasing your computer's performance. Actively used memory is not interfered with.

- This feature allows you to find files that you can't find even in the classic windows file explorer. Another difference from the file explorer is that it is faster.

- 3.2 File Shedder
- This feature uses sophisticated techniques to completely delete the file of your choice from your computer so that even file recovery software cannot recover it.
- First, it corrupts the file by replacing its contents with random information.It then changes the extension of the file. This binary case is performed more than once. The file is then deleted and overwritten with a new file, completely destroying it on the disk.
- There is no way to recover the file you delete with this feature

### Device Maneger

- This feature acts as a shortcut to open the device manager
